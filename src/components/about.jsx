        <p>
          As a product leader and strategic advisor, I help organizations create
          sustainable growth through empathy, data-driven product decisions and clear
          strategic vision. My experience spans from building early-stage startups to
          transforming enterprise product organizations, always focusing on aligning
          mission and impact with business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I partner with artists, creators, and mission-driven organizations
          to build better products and sustainable operations. Over the past 10+
          years, I've worked on products, services and tools in education, media
          and arts, finance, and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          My core values are instilled in how I build with a focus on creating
          individual and community agency, sustainability, and impact. I especially
          love working with people who are expressing themselves through the arts
          and who are solving critical societal issues.
